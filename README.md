# Web-Scraping-with-Python-using-the-Beautiful-Soup-Library
1) I am scraping a webiste "timesjobs" and will fetch only those jobs which are few posted days ago. 

2) The user needs to enter the one skill that he is not familiar with and the program will exclude that skill from the result.  

3) I am scraping 3 things   a) Company Name  b) Required Skills  c) Link to Apply  

4) I also wrote a function that will fetch the results from the website after every 10 minutes. 

5) The website link that I am scrapping ->https://www.timesjobs.com/candidate/job-search.html?searchType=personalizedSearch&amp;from=submit&amp;txtKeywords=python&amp;txtLocation=
